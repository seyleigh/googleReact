# React GOOGLE books
This app is built using react.
You can search for your favourite books using a Google API and save them to a mongo database to view later. If you change your mind about a book you saved you can delete it from the saved books.
I had to remake this repo because the first app I made broke when I was trying to deploy. TA couldn't even figure out what happened. I just love heroku.

If you're trying to run the app locally just clone the repo and navigate to the root folder then run:
```
npm start
```
